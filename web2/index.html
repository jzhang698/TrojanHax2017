				<h4>TrojanHealthBot</h4>
				<p>In Machine Learning, the Perceptron is an algorithm for learning binary classifiers. Given large sets of data, it can gradually learn to divide objects into two distinct groups based on certain characteristics. With more data, it can more accurately draw a line between the groups by "plotting" the data and adjusting the linear decision boundaries.</p>
				<p>For Spring 2017 Trojan Hacks, our team is implementing a machine learning algorithm to diagnose abnormal heart complications. This algorithm can be used to help save lives and make better predictions than doctors.</p>
				<p>It is a simple, deep neural network!</p>

				<h1>Background Information</h1>
				<p>We implemented a multilayer perceptron to create a simple, deep, neural network. By training this network with known patient information, we were able to predict (given a patient's data) whether he/she has a heart abnormality. Here is how we did it:</p>

					<h3>Source of Data</h3>
					<p>Our training and testing points were obtained from UCI's Machine learning Database of the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Testing data of 267 patients.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>What Is an MPI?</h3>
					<p>The method of obtaining the MPI data was through Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography, which is a type of MPI testing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>Classification</h3>
					<p>After training the algorithm with the data set, it was able to classify the people into 2 groups - normal and abnormal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>Our Results</h3>
					<p>The algorithm was able to classify at most over 80% of the test inputs correctly after being trained by 120 data points.

				<h4>Brief Explanation of the Algorithm</h4>
				<p>The perceptron algorithm takes in an initial data point and draws a divider arbitrarily, as that point is the first to be plotted. After the second data point is drawn, it adjusts the divider accordingly. For example, if the first and second points are in opposite groups, then the divider goes between them in some way. The slope of the graph is the weight of the data points and the y-intercept is the bias.</p>
