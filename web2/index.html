				<h4>TrojanHealthBot</h4>
				<p>In Machine Learning, the Perceptron is an algorithm for learning binary classifiers. Given large sets of data, it can gradually learn to divide objects into two distinct groups based on certain characteristics. With more data, it can more accurately draw a line between the groups by "plotting" the data and adjusting the linear decision boundaries.</p>
				<p>For Spring 2017 Trojan Hacks, our team is implementing a machine learning algorithm to diagnose abnormal heart complications. This algorithm can be used to help save lives and make better predictions than doctors.</p>
				<p>It is a simple, deep neural network!</p>

				<h1>Our Implementation</h1>
				<p>We implemented a multi-layer perceptron to create a simple, deep, neural network. Here is how we did it:</p>
			</div>
			<div style="height: 30px"></div>
			<div class="row text-center">
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>Our Source of Data</h3>
					<p>Our data was obtained from UCI's _____ something lab?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>What Was the Data?</h3>
					<p>This data was of some patients or shit like that something heart disease?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>What Were we Looking For?</h3>
					<p>After training the algorithm with the data set, it was able to classify the people into 2 groups - healthy and unhealthy</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3 info">
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>The algorithm was able to classify ___% of the inputs correctly after being trained by ___ data points. There was no significant further improvement through further training due to the law of diminising returns</p>
