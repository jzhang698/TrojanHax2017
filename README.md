# Trojan Hacks Spring 2017: Machine Learning

# TrojanHealthBot

For Spring 2017 Trojan Hacks, our team is implementing a Multilayer Perceptron algorithm to diagnose abnormal heart complications. This algorithm can be used to help save lives. For now it can be used as a tool to help diagnose patients, but with better data it could make better predictions than doctors.

We will be using the MatPlotLib library in Python to create graphs of our data.
