Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography is a method of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Testing


Who Gets it?:
	- People with chest discomfort
	- They want to see if it's from lack of blood flow to heart or narrowed/blocked arteries

What happens:
	- Radioactive isotopes (of some non toxic substance like Gallium) injected into bloodstream
	- The patient's heart rate is elevated through exercise/medicines (hence the term stress test)
	- These "tracers" go through the patients blood and are able to be read by the "gamma camera"
	- Electrodes are attached for an EKG (ST elevation, dropped pq waves -> heart block, etc)
	- images are taken of the heart (in cross sections) by the camera giving off gamma rays. (64 according to mom)
	- safe because gamma rays aren't like alpha or beta particles and don't stay since no mass (EM Spectrum)

What can it tell?:
	- blocked/narrowed arteries -> can't directly tell but can see slower blood flow/accumulation of isotope
	- scar tissue (dead tissue areas with no isotope)
	- Determine if you can benefit from a stent/test if stent is working (interventional cardiologist)
	- How well your heart handles stress
	- It can also be used on the brain and the rest of the body but that's not related to our project


Our algorithm was trained on the data of up to 120 patients. These patients had their SPECT data condensed into 22 binary features.

Sources of Error:
	- A neural network is only as good as the data points that it trains with
	- SO, if these data points were skewed or had any outliers, then that could lead to a skew in the linear boundary
	- The training in the beginning has more effect on the boundary than later data points, so if an "imperfect" data point used earlier, more skew
	- We try to avoid these errors by weighting the initial training so the model tends to converge around several local minima
	- However, there are still significant skews in the data occasionally.

Perceptron - Implemented by Peter
	- The graph shows that the law of diminishing returns has been reached. This has a very steep and fast learning curve.


What it does:
	- Takes in data
	




Our data:
	- Each trial has a bit of variation because the results vary depending on the order of training with data points.
